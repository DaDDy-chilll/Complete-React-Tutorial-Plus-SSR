# This fork

The repository, from which this fork was made, creates a React blog application. It is a good example of how to create a React app using `create-react-app` and is hopefully clean enough (following most conventions and vanilla React app layout) to convert the blog to SSR.

# Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using WebAssembly (Wasm)

In addition to the original working code, which is essentially a Client-Side Rendered (CSR) Single Page Application (SPA), this fork is created to develop, test and demonstrate how a React app can be converted to Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Specifically, how to use [WasmEdge's QuickJS](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs) and the [WasmEdge runtime](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge) to build and deploy the blog app.
